## Common patterns

**General Plumbing** is the baseline — almost every plumber offers this. If they've only selected this, probe whether they do hot water, gas, and drains.

**Gas Fitting requires a separate license.** Not all plumbers are licensed gas fitters. If they haven't selected Gas Fitting or Gas Hot Water Systems, don't assume they can do gas work.

**Emergency Plumbing** means 24/7 availability. Some plumbers don't offer this — they work standard hours only. If they've selected it, they're set up for after-hours callouts.

**Hot Water Systems** is a parent term. If selected alone, clarify whether they do electric, gas, solar, or all three. Gas requires a license; solar is specialist work.

**Drain work** has levels of complexity. Blocked toilet/sink is simple. Drain repairs may require CCTV inspection, jet blasting, or excavation — not all plumbers have this equipment.

**Commercial vs Residential** is a real divide. Commercial plumbers deal with larger systems, compliance certificates, strata requirements, and often work outside business hours.

| General Plumbing | Emergency Plumbing | Whether they do after-hours callouts |
| Blocked drains/toilets | Drain Repairs | Whether they do pipe repairs or just clearing |
| Residential services | Commercial Plumbing | Whether they take on commercial jobs |
| Hot Water Systems | Solar Hot Water | Whether they do solar (it's specialist) |
