# Perth Service Area Guide

## How to use this guide

You have the tradie's suburb and can calculate distances via lat/long. The default service area is a 20km radius — but geography reshapes this into a blob, not a circle.

**Your job:** Identify which barriers, corridors, congestion zones, or high-demand areas are relevant to this tradie's location, then ask smart questions to reshape their blob. Always offer "I'll travel anywhere in Perth" as an easy exit.

**Key principles:**
- Barriers create hard edges — the blob stops there unless they explicitly say otherwise
- Congestion zones shrink the blob in that direction — travel time exceeds what distance suggests
- Corridors extend the blob along that axis — distance becomes less relevant
- High-demand areas may stretch the blob — tradies often travel further toward these
- Perth is linear (north-south along the coast) and sprawling — distance is often the main constraint rather than barriers

## Barriers

Hard cutoffs where road access is blocked or severely constrained.

| Barrier | Type | Suburbs affected |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Swan River | Water (several bridges) | Divides north/south of river |
| Indian Ocean | Water | Western edge |
| Darling Scarp | Terrain (steep escarpment) | Eastern edge — hills suburbs have limited access |
| Rottnest Island | Water | No road access |
| Fremantle Harbour | Water/industrial | Limits north-south coastal route |

---

## Congestion zones

Routes where travel time significantly exceeds what distance suggests.

| Zone | Pain point | Affects travel to/from |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| Mitchell Freeway (inner sections) | Volume at peak | Northern suburbs to CBD |
| Kwinana Freeway (inner sections) | Volume at peak | Southern suburbs to CBD |
| Stirling Highway | Slow, many lights | Western suburbs to Fremantle |
| Canning Highway | Congested arterial | South of river east-west |
| Great Eastern Highway | Slow through Midland | Eastern suburbs, hills |
| Narrows Bridge | Main river crossing, bottleneck | North-south through CBD |
| Causeway | Eastern river crossing, queues | Victoria Park, Burswood area |

---

## Corridors

Routes where travel is easier than distance suggests.

| Corridor | Connects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Mitchell Freeway | CBD ↔ Northern suburbs (to Joondalup+) | Free |
| Kwinana Freeway | CBD ↔ Southern suburbs (to Mandurah) | Free |
| Roe Highway | East-west connector (Midland to Fremantle area) | Free |
| Tonkin Highway | Eastern suburbs north-south | Free |
| Reid Highway | Northern east-west connector | Free |
| Forrest Highway | South to Bunbury | Free, but long distance |
| NorthLink WA | Ellenbrook ↔ Morley ↔ Tonkin | Free, newer |

## High-demand areas

Areas tradies commonly stretch their service area toward.

| Area | Why it pulls |
|------|--------------|
| Western suburbs (Cottesloe, Claremont, Nedlands) | High-value properties near river/coast |
| South Perth / Como | Established, river views |
| City Beach / Scarborough | Coastal renovations |
| Applecross / Mt Pleasant | Affluent, large homes |
| Joondalup corridor | Northern growth, mix of established and new |
| Rockingham / Baldivis | Southern growth corridor, new construction |
| Ellenbrook / The Vines | North-east growth corridor |
| Byford / Mundijong | South-east growth corridor |

## Local terminology

Phrases tradies use that need clarification:

| Phrase | Could mean |
|--------|------------|
| "North of the river" / "South of the river" | Swan River divide — strong local identity |
| "The hills" | Darling Scarp suburbs (Kalamunda, Mundaring, Roleystone) |
| "Up north" | Could be Joondalup area or as far as Two Rocks |
| "Down south" | Could be Fremantle, Rockingham, or even Mandurah |
| "Out east" | Midland, hills, or as far as Mundaring |
| "The port" | Fremantle |
| "NOR" / "SOR" | North of river / South of river — very common usage |
