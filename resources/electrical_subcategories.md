# Electrical — Subcategory Guide

## How to use this guide

When verifying an electrician's service offerings, use this guide to understand what each subcategory actually means in practice. This helps you ask smarter questions, spot gaps, and understand why an electrician might or might not offer certain services.

**Your goal:** Ensure the tradie is getting leads for work they actually do — and NOT getting leads for work they don't do. This isn't about quoting, it's about filtering.

## Subcategory breakdown

| Subcategory | What it means in practice | Equipment/skill notes |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **General Electrician** | Catch-all for standard residential and light commercial electrical work | Core bread-and-butter, most electricians select this |
| **Rewiring** | Replacing old wiring in existing homes — partial or full rewire | Major job, requires wall/ceiling access, often in older homes |
| **Switchboards** | Switchboard upgrades, replacements, adding circuits | Common job — old ceramic fuse boards to modern RCD boards |
| **Safety Switches** | Installing RCDs (residual current devices) for safety compliance | Mandatory in many states, quick install job |
| **Lighting** | LED upgrades, downlight installation, outdoor lighting, security lighting | Very common — ranges from simple globe changes to full lighting design |
| **Ceiling Fan Installation** | Fitting ceiling fans, replacing old fans, adding fan points | Needs structural support knowledge, common residential job |
| **Data Cabling** | Cat6/Cat6a ethernet, phone points, network infrastructure | Separate endorsement needed in some states |
| **Home Theatre** | TV mounting, surround sound, media room wiring | Often bundled with data cabling, AV knowledge helpful |
| **Smoke Alarms** | Installation, replacement, interconnection of smoke detectors | Compliance requirements vary by state — common callout |
| **Solar Panel Installation** | Rooftop solar PV system installation | Requires CEC accreditation — specialist work |
| **EV Charger Installation** | Electric vehicle home charging stations | Growing market, requires dedicated circuit and sometimes switchboard upgrade |
| **Level 2 Electrician** | Mains connections, meter installations, overhead/underground service lines | Separate license — connects to the grid, not all sparkies have this |
| **Emergency Electrician** | After-hours urgent callouts — power outages, sparking, safety hazards | Willingness to work nights/weekends at premium rates |
| **Electrical Safety Inspection** | Pre-purchase inspections, compliance checks, safety audits | Report-writing, thorough testing, insurance implications |
| **Powerpoint Installation** | Adding, relocating, or upgrading power outlets and USB points | Standard residential work, straightforward |
| **Air Conditioning** | Split system and ducted AC installation, electrical connection | Some electricians install full units, others just do the electrical connection |

## Common patterns

**Most residential electricians** offer General Electrician, Lighting, Powerpoint Installation, Switchboards, Safety Switches, Smoke Alarms, and Ceiling Fans as their core bundle. These are everyday jobs.

**Solar** is a major specialisation. It requires CEC (Clean Energy Council) accreditation. If an electrician hasn't selected Solar, don't suggest it — they likely don't have the accreditation. If they have, it's usually a big part of their business.

**Level 2 Electrician** is a separate license (ASP Level 2 or equivalent). This covers mains work — connecting to the grid, meter installations, overhead lines. Standard electricians can't do this work. Always confirm if selected.

**EV Charger Installation** is a growing niche. It's accessible to most electricians (dedicated 32A or 40A circuit) but some are marketing it as a specialty. If not selected, it might just be an oversight.

**Data Cabling** requires a separate endorsement (ACMA cabler registration) in some states. Don't assume all electricians can do structured cabling.

**Air Conditioning** is a grey area. The electrical connection is standard sparky work, but the refrigerant side requires an ARCtick license. Some electricians are dual-qualified, others just do the electrical hookup after a refrigeration tech installs the unit.

**Emergency work** isn't a separate skill — it's about availability and willingness to do after-hours callouts at premium rates.

## Gaps to watch for

| If they've selected... | But not... | Ask about... |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| General Electrician | Lighting | Whether they do LED upgrades and downlights (very common work) |
| Lighting + Powerpoints | Switchboards | Whether they do switchboard upgrades (common need in older homes) |
| General Electrician | Smoke Alarms | Whether they do smoke alarm compliance work |
| Switchboards | Safety Switches | Whether they install RCDs (usually bundled) |
| General Electrician | Solar | Whether they're CEC accredited (don't assume) |
| General Electrician | EV Charger | Whether they install EV chargers (growing market) |
| Everything | Level 2 | Whether they have ASP Level 2 license |
| General Electrician | Data Cabling | Whether they do network/data points |
| General Electrician | Air Conditioning | Whether they install split systems or just the electrical side |

## Handling missing subcategories

**If they've selected most but not all:**
- Name the missing one(s) specifically: "You've got everything except [X] — is that something you do, or do you prefer to avoid it?"
- If only 1-2 missing, ask directly
- If 3+ missing, ask if there's a reason: "I notice you haven't selected [X, Y, Z] — are those outside your scope, or just ones you missed?"

**If they've selected all:**
- Confirm briefly: "Great, so you're happy to take on any electrical job that comes through?"
- Double-check accreditations: CEC for solar, Level 2 license, data cabling endorsement

**If they've selected very few:**
- Probe for their specialty: "Looks like you're focused on [X] — is that your main thing, or do you take other electrical work too?"
