## Common patterns

**Level 2 Electrician is a separate accreditation.** Standard electricians can't do mains work, meter installations, or power pole connections. If someone needs their power connected or meter upgraded, they need a Level 2. Always clarify if they have this.

**Solar requires CEC accreditation.** Not all electricians can install solar panels — they need Clean Energy Council accreditation. If they haven't selected Solar, don't assume they can do it.

**Emergency Electrician** means 24/7 availability. Many electricians work standard hours only. If they've selected it, they're set up for after-hours callouts.

**Data Cabling** is often a separate specialty. Some electricians do power only; others do data as well. If a job involves network cabling, confirm they do it.

**TV Antenna work** is frequently a separate trade altogether. Many electricians don't touch antennas — there are dedicated antenna technicians.

**Smoke Alarms** have compliance requirements that vary by state — particularly for rental properties and sales. Electricians who select this are usually across the regulations.
