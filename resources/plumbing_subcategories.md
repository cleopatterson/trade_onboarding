# Plumbing — Subcategory Guide

## How to use this guide

When verifying a plumber's service offerings, use this guide to understand what each subcategory actually means in practice. This helps you ask smarter questions, spot gaps, and understand why a plumber might or might not offer certain services.

**Your goal:** Ensure the tradie is getting leads for work they actually do — and NOT getting leads for work they don't do. This isn't about quoting, it's about filtering.

## Subcategory breakdown

| Subcategory | What it means in practice | Equipment/skill notes |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **General Plumbing** | Catch-all for standard residential plumbing — taps, toilets, pipes, fixtures | Core bread-and-butter work, most plumbers select this |
| **Hot Water Systems** | Electric and heat pump hot water installation, repair, replacement | Needs to understand different brands/types (Rheem, Rinnai, Dux etc.) |
| **Gas Hot Water** | Gas-fired storage and continuous flow hot water systems | Requires gas fitting license — not all plumbers have this |
| **Solar Hot Water** | Solar thermal hot water systems (panels + tank) | Specialist install, often involves roof work and boosters |
| **Drain Repairs** | Fixing broken, cracked, or collapsed drain pipes | May need CCTV camera, pipe relining equipment |
| **Drainage & Sewers** | Larger sewer line work, stormwater, drainage systems | More involved than simple drain repairs — excavation may be needed |
| **Emergency Plumbing** | After-hours urgent callouts — burst pipes, major leaks, no hot water | Requires willingness to work nights/weekends, higher rates |
| **Plumbing Installation** | New fixtures, bathrooms, kitchens, laundries — new build or reno | Coordination with other trades, plan reading |
| **Toilet Repairs** | Cistern repairs, replacements, blocked toilets | Common callout, straightforward for most plumbers |
| **Gas Fitting** | Gas appliance installation — cooktops, heaters, BBQs, gas lines | Requires separate gas fitting license |
| **Blocked Drains** | Clearing blockages in sinks, toilets, floor drains, sewer lines | Electric eel, high-pressure jetter, CCTV inspection |
| **Leaking Taps** | Tap washer replacement, cartridge repair, mixer tap fixes | Entry-level work, very common callout |
| **Pipe Repairs** | Fixing burst, leaking, or corroded pipes | May involve wall/floor access, pipe materials vary (copper, PEX, PVC) |
| **Water Leaks** | Leak detection and repair — hidden leaks, meter running, damp walls | Some specialise in detection with thermal/acoustic equipment |
| **Backflow Prevention** | Installing and testing backflow prevention devices | Requires specific accreditation/testing license |
| **Roof Plumbing/Guttering** | Gutters, downpipes, roof flashings, box gutters | Working at height, sheet metal skills — some general plumbers avoid this |

## Common patterns

**Most general plumbers** offer General Plumbing, Leaking Taps, Toilet Repairs, Pipe Repairs, and Blocked Drains as their core bundle. These are the everyday callout jobs.

**Gas Fitting** is a major divider. It requires a separate license (Gas Fitter License). If a plumber doesn't have it, they can't touch gas lines, gas hot water, cooktops, or heaters. Always confirm if they've selected gas-related subcategories.

**Hot Water Systems** is where the money is. Replacements are $1,500-$4,000+ jobs. Plumbers who do hot water usually handle electric, gas, and sometimes solar. If they've selected Hot Water but not Gas Hot Water, confirm they only do electric/heat pump.

**Emergency Plumbing** isn't a separate skill — it's a willingness to do after-hours work at premium rates. Some plumbers love it (higher margins), others avoid it (work-life balance). Worth confirming if selected.

**Drain work** splits into simple (blocked drains — electric eel job) and complex (drain repairs, sewer relining). A plumber with a jetter and CCTV camera is set up for drain work. One without may only do basic unblocking.

**Backflow Prevention** requires specific accreditation to test devices. Plumbers who have it usually mention it. If not selected, don't assume they can do it.

**Roof Plumbing** is increasingly a separate trade. General plumbers may do basic gutter work but avoid complex roof plumbing. If selected, confirm the scope.

## Gaps to watch for

| If they've selected... | But not... | Ask about... |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| General Plumbing | Hot Water Systems | Whether they install/replace hot water (big revenue item) |
| Hot Water Systems | Gas Hot Water | Whether they have a gas fitting license |
| Blocked Drains | Drain Repairs | Whether they do repairs or just clearing blockages |
| General Plumbing | Emergency Plumbing | Whether they take after-hours calls |
| Gas Hot Water | Gas Fitting | Whether they install gas appliances (cooktops, heaters) |
| Everything | Backflow Prevention | Whether they're accredited for backflow testing |
| General Plumbing | Roof Plumbing/Guttering | Whether they do gutter/downpipe work |

## Handling missing subcategories

**If they've selected most but not all:**
- Name the missing one(s) specifically: "You've got everything except [X] — is that something you do, or do you prefer to avoid it?"
- If only 1-2 missing, ask directly
- If 3+ missing, ask if there's a reason: "I notice you haven't selected [X, Y, Z] — are those outside your scope, or just ones you missed?"

**If they've selected all:**
- Confirm briefly: "Great, so you're happy to take on any plumbing job that comes through?"
- Double-check gas fitting license if gas subcategories are selected

**If they've selected very few:**
- Probe for their specialty: "Looks like you're focused on [X] — is that your main thing, or do you take other plumbing work too?"
