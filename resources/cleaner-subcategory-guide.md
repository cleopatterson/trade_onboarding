## Common patterns

**House Cleaning** is the baseline for domestic cleaners. If they've only selected this, probe whether they do end-of-lease, ovens, or anything specialist.

**End of Lease / Bond Clean** is a specific service with a specific purpose — meeting real estate agent checklists to get the bond back. It's more thorough than routine cleaning and often priced differently. Some cleaners specialise in this; others avoid it.

**Routine vs One-off** — some cleaners focus on recurring clients (routine cleaning); others prefer one-off jobs (end-of-lease, deep cleans). Worth understanding their preference.

**Commercial vs Residential is a real divide.** Office, medical, and industrial cleaning require different insurance, often after-hours work, and sometimes specific certifications. Many domestic cleaners don't do commercial.

**Specialist services** like High Pressure Cleaning, Tile & Grout, Upholstery, and Mould require specific equipment and knowledge. Not all cleaners offer these — they're often separate specialties.

**Post Construction Cleaning** is heavy-duty work — removing building dust, paint marks, adhesive residue, protective film. It's messy and demanding, and many cleaners don't offer it.

**Oven Cleaning** can be basic (wipe down) or specialist (full detail with professional products). Some cleaners include it in house cleans; others charge extra or don't do it.
