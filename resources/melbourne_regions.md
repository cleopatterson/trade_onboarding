# Melbourne Service Area Guide

## How to use this guide

You have the tradie's suburb and can calculate distances via lat/long. The default service area is a 20km radius — but geography reshapes this into a blob, not a circle.

**Your job:** Identify which barriers, corridors, congestion zones, or high-demand areas are relevant to this tradie's location, then ask smart questions to reshape their blob. Always offer "I'll travel anywhere in Melbourne" as an easy exit.

**Key principles:**
- Barriers create hard edges — the blob stops there unless they explicitly say otherwise
- Congestion zones shrink the blob in that direction — travel time exceeds what distance suggests
- Corridors extend the blob along that axis — distance becomes less relevant
- High-demand areas may stretch the blob — tradies often travel further toward these
- Melbourne is flatter and more grid-like than Sydney — fewer hard barriers, more congestion-based constraints

## Barriers

Hard cutoffs where road access is blocked or severely constrained.

| Barrier | Type | Suburbs affected |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Port Phillip Bay | Water | Defines southern edge of metro — no crossing |
| Yarra River | Water (many bridges) | Soft barrier — more psychological than physical |
| Dandenong Ranges | Terrain | Eastern edge — steep, winding roads |
| Western Ring Road gap | No direct connection | Limits north-west to south-east travel |
| Mornington Peninsula | Geography | Long peninsula — distant from rest of metro |

---

## Congestion zones

Routes where travel time significantly exceeds what distance suggests.

| Zone | Pain point | Affects travel to/from |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| Hoddle Street / Punt Road | Chronic congestion, north-south | Inner east to CBD |
| West Gate Bridge | Only western crossing, bottleneck | Western suburbs to city/south-east |
| Monash Freeway | Heavy volume, slow peak hours | South-east corridor |
| Princes Highway (south-east) | Single arterial, no alternatives | Dandenong, Pakenham |
| Bell Street | East-west bottleneck | Northern suburbs |
| Nepean Highway | Slow, many lights | Bayside to Peninsula |

## Corridors

Routes where travel is easier than distance suggests.

| Corridor | Connects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| CityLink | West Gate ↔ Tullamarine ↔ Eastern Freeway | Tolled, key connector |
| EastLink | Eastern suburbs north-south | Tolled, fast |
| Western Ring Road | West ↔ North (Laverton to Greensborough) | Free, avoids CBD |
| Monash Freeway | CBD ↔ South-east (off-peak) | Free, but peak congestion |
| Eastern Freeway | CBD ↔ Eastern suburbs | Free |
| Metropolitan Ring Road | Northern suburbs connector | Free |
| West Gate Tunnel | City ↔ West (via port) | Tolled, new option |

## High-demand areas

Areas tradies commonly stretch their service area toward.

| Area | Why it pulls |
|------|--------------|
| Inner East (Toorak, South Yarra, Hawthorn) | High-value properties, renovation demand |
| Bayside (Brighton, Sandringham) | Established wealthy suburbs |
| Inner North (Fitzroy, Brunswick, Northcote) | Dense renovation activity, heritage |
| Stonnington / Boroondara | Large homes, ongoing maintenance |
| Mornington Peninsula | Holiday homes, seasonal demand |
| Western growth corridor (Werribee, Tarneit, Truganina) | High volume new construction |
| South-east growth corridor (Clyde, Cranbourne, Pakenham) | High volume new construction |
| North growth corridor (Craigieburn, Mickleham, Donnybrook) | High volume new construction |

## Local terminology

Phrases tradies use that need clarification:

| Phrase | Could mean |
|--------|------------|
| "The Peninsula" | Mornington Peninsula |
| "The Bay" | Port Phillip Bay or Bayside suburbs |
| "Out east" | Could be inner east (Hawthorn) or outer east (Ringwood, Lilydale) |
| "The west" | Inner west (Footscray) vs outer west (Werribee) — very different |
| "South-east" | Could mean Dandenong corridor or Bayside — clarify |
| "Over the bridge" | Usually West Gate Bridge |
| "The ranges" | Dandenong Ranges |
| "Up north" | Could be inner north (Brunswick) or outer north (Craigieburn) |
