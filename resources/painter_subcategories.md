# Painter — Subcategory Guide

## How to use this guide

When verifying a painter's service offerings, use this guide to understand what each subcategory actually means in practice. This helps you ask smarter questions, spot gaps, and understand why a painter might or might not offer certain services.

**Your goal:** Ensure the tradie is getting leads for work they actually do — and NOT getting leads for work they don't do. This isn't about quoting, it's about filtering.

## Subcategory breakdown

| Subcategory | What it means in practice | Equipment/skill notes |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **House Painting** | General term covering residential painting — usually implies both interior and exterior | If selected alone, confirm whether they do both inside and out |
| **Interior House Painting** | Walls, ceilings, doors, trim, skirting boards inside homes | Standard painting skills, most common work type |
| **Exterior House Painting** | Weatherboards, render, brick, fascia, eaves, window frames | Requires ladders/scaffolding, weather-dependent scheduling |
| **Roof Painting** | Painting or coating tile, metal, or Colorbond roofs | Specialist work — requires harness/safety gear, roof-specific coatings, not all painters do this |
| **Commercial Painting** | Offices, retail shops, warehouses, factories, strata common areas | Larger scale, often after-hours or weekend work, may need specific insurance |
| **Fence Painting** | Timber fences, gates, outdoor structures | Usually bundled with exterior work, straightforward |
| **Floor Painting** | Garage floors, verandahs, concrete slabs | Requires floor-specific epoxy or paint, surface prep important |
| **Concrete Painting** | Driveways, paths, retaining walls, rendered surfaces | Overlaps with floor painting, needs primers for porous surfaces |
| **Paint Removal** | Stripping old paint before repainting — chemical, heat gun, or sanding | Some specialise in lead paint removal (pre-1970s homes) which requires certification |
| **Wallpapering** | Hanging new wallpaper, removing old wallpaper, feature walls | Distinct skill from painting — many painters do it, but some don't touch it |

## Common patterns

**Most residential painters** offer Interior + Exterior + Fence as a standard bundle. If they've selected these, they likely cover the core residential market.

**Roof Painting** is often either a specialty or avoided entirely. It requires working at height with safety equipment, and the coatings are different. Don't assume a house painter does roofs.

**Commercial vs Residential** is a real divide. Commercial painters deal with larger spaces, different scheduling (after-hours), strata/body corporate requirements, and need public liability insurance that covers commercial sites. Some do both, many stick to one or the other.

**Floor and Concrete Painting** overlap significantly. Both require surface prep (cleaning, etching, priming) and specific coatings (epoxy, floor paint). A painter who does one usually does the other.

**Wallpapering** is hit-or-miss. It's a distinct skill — measuring, pattern matching, paste application. Some painters include it as part of their service, others subcontract it out or don't offer it at all. Always worth confirming.

**Paint Removal** can mean simple prep work (sanding, scraping) or specialist lead paint removal. For older homes (pre-1970s), lead paint removal requires specific licensing and safety procedures — not all painters are qualified.

## Gaps to watch for

| If they've selected... | But not... | Ask about... |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| House Painting | Interior or Exterior separately | Whether they do both inside and out |
| Interior + Exterior | Fence Painting | Whether fences/gates are included or separate |
| Residential types only | Commercial Painting | Whether they take commercial jobs |
| All painting types | Wallpapering | Whether they do wallpaper or just paint |
| Floor Painting | Concrete Painting | Whether they do driveways/paths (likely yes) |
| Everything | Paint Removal | Whether they handle lead paint (if relevant to older homes) |

## Handling missing subcategories

**If they've selected most but not all:**
- Name the missing one(s) specifically: "You've got everything except [X] — is that something you do, or do you prefer to avoid it?"
- If only 1-2 missing, ask directly
- If 3+ missing, ask if there's a reason: "I notice you haven't selected [X, Y, Z] — are those outside your scope, or just ones you missed?"

**If they've selected all:**
- Confirm briefly: "Great, so you're happy to take on any painting job that comes through?"

**If they've selected very few:**
- Probe for their specialty: "Looks like you're focused on [X] — is that your main thing, or do you take other painting work too?"
