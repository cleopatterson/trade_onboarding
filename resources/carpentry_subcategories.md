# Carpentry — Subcategory Guide

## How to use this guide

When verifying a carpenter's service offerings, use this guide to understand what each subcategory actually means in practice. This helps you ask smarter questions, spot gaps, and understand why a carpenter might or might not offer certain services.

**Your goal:** Ensure the tradie is getting leads for work they actually do — and NOT getting leads for work they don't do. This isn't about quoting, it's about filtering.

## Subcategory breakdown

| Subcategory | What it means in practice | Equipment/skill notes |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **General Carpentry** | Catch-all for standard residential carpentry — framing, fixing, repairs | Core bread-and-butter work, most carpenters select this |
| **Cabinetmaking** | Custom built-in wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, vanities, entertainment units | Workshop-based skill — not all site carpenters do this |
| **Deck Building** | Timber and composite decks — new builds, replacements, extensions | Very common work, requires knowledge of timber species and council regs |
| **Pergolas** | Timber and steel pergola construction — freestanding or attached | Often bundled with deck work, structural engineering may be needed for larger builds |
| **Door Installation** | Hanging new doors, replacing frames, sliding doors, bifolds, French doors | Common callout — ranges from simple door hang to full frame replacement |
| **Window Installation** | Replacing windows, new window openings, timber window repairs | May need structural work for new openings, heritage window repair is specialist |
| **Timber Flooring** | Installing, sanding, polishing hardwood and engineered timber floors | Specialist equipment (floor sander, buffer), dustless systems preferred |
| **Staircase Building** | New staircases, replacement, balustrades, handrails | Complex geometry, BCA compliance for balustrade height/spacing |
| **Structural Carpentry** | Load-bearing walls, beams, roof framing, house frames | Heavy-duty work, often new builds or major renovations |
| **Formwork** | Concrete formwork for footings, slabs, retaining walls, columns | Commercial/construction focus — different from residential finish carpentry |
| **Fit-out/Joinery** | Internal fit-outs, custom joinery, shop fitting, office partitions | Commercial and high-end residential — precision work |
| **Shelving/Storage** | Built-in shelving, wardrobes, pantry fit-outs, garage storage | Common residential job, ranges from basic brackets to custom builds |
| **Fence Building (Timber)** | Timber paling fences, picket fences, timber gates | Overlaps with fencing trade — some carpenters do it, some don't |
| **Restoration/Heritage** | Restoring period features, heritage-listed building repairs, ornate timber work | Specialist niche — requires knowledge of traditional methods and heritage regulations |

## Common patterns

**Most residential carpenters** offer General Carpentry, Deck Building, Door Installation, and Shelving/Storage as their core bundle. These are the everyday jobs that keep them busy.

**Deck Building + Pergolas** almost always go together. A carpenter who builds decks typically builds pergolas too. If one is selected without the other, it's likely an oversight.

**Cabinetmaking** is a distinct trade. Many site carpenters don't do custom cabinetry — it requires a workshop, specialised machinery (panel saw, edgebander, CNC router), and different skills. Don't assume a general carpenter makes cabinets.

**Timber Flooring** is increasingly a specialist trade. Sanding and polishing requires expensive equipment and experience to get right. Some carpenters install but subcontract the sanding/polishing. If selected, confirm whether they do the full job.

**Structural Carpentry vs Fit-out** represents a real divide. Structural carpenters work on frames, load-bearing walls, and roof structures. Fit-out carpenters do precision interior work. Some do both, many lean one way.

**Formwork** is predominantly commercial/construction work. If a residential carpenter has selected it, they may also do some commercial work. If they haven't, they probably focus on residential finish carpentry.

**Restoration/Heritage** is a premium niche. It requires knowledge of traditional joinery, heritage regulations, and often period-specific materials. Carpenters who do this work can command higher rates.

**Fence Building** overlaps with the fencing trade. Some carpenters include timber fencing as part of their offering, especially if they already build decks and pergolas. Others leave it to dedicated fencers.

## Gaps to watch for

| If they've selected... | But not... | Ask about... |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Deck Building | Pergolas | Whether they build pergolas too (usually yes) |
| General Carpentry | Deck Building | Whether they do outdoor structures (common work) |
| General Carpentry | Door Installation | Whether they hang doors and do frame repairs |
| Fit-out/Joinery | Cabinetmaking | Whether they make custom cabinets or just install them |
| Deck + Pergola | Fence Building | Whether they do timber fencing as well |
| General Carpentry | Timber Flooring | Whether they install/sand timber floors (specialist) |
| Structural Carpentry | General Carpentry | Whether they also do finishing work or just structural |
| Everything | Restoration/Heritage | Whether they have heritage experience (premium niche) |

## Handling missing subcategories

**If they've selected most but not all:**
- Name the missing one(s) specifically: "You've got everything except [X] — is that something you do, or do you prefer to avoid it?"
- If only 1-2 missing, ask directly
- If 3+ missing, ask if there's a reason: "I notice you haven't selected [X, Y, Z] — are those outside your scope, or just ones you missed?"

**If they've selected all:**
- Confirm briefly: "Great, so you're happy to take on any carpentry job that comes through?"
- Double-check if they do cabinetmaking (workshop work) vs site carpentry — having both is unusual

**If they've selected very few:**
- Probe for their specialty: "Looks like you're focused on [X] — is that your main thing, or do you take other carpentry work too?"
