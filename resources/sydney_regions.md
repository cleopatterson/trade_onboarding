# Sydney Service Area Guide

## How to use this guide

You have the tradie's suburb and can calculate distances via lat/long. The default service area is a 20km radius — but geography reshapes this into a blob, not a circle.

**Your job:** Identify which barriers, corridors, congestion zones, or high-demand areas are relevant to this tradie's location, then ask smart questions to reshape their service area. Always offer "I'll travel anywhere in Sydney" as an easy exit.

**Key principles:**
- Barriers create hard edges — the service area stops there unless they explicitly say otherwise
- Congestion zones shrink the area in that direction — travel time exceeds what distance suggests
- Corridors extend the area along that axis — distance becomes less relevant
- High-demand areas may stretch the area — tradies often travel further toward these
- If a tradie says "the bridge" or "the Shire" — clarify which one, these terms are ambiguous

## Barriers

Hard cutoffs where road access is blocked or severely constrained.

| Barrier | Type | Suburbs affected |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Sydney Harbour | Water (Bridge/Tunnel only) | Divides entire metro north/south |
| Spit Bridge | Water + bottleneck | Northern Beaches access |
| Georges River | Water (3 bridges) | Divides St George from Sutherland Shire |
| Broken Bay | Water (no crossing) | North of Palm Beach — no road access |
| Royal National Park | No roads through | South of Sutherland Shire |
| Ku-ring-gai Chase NP | No roads through | West/north of Northern Beaches |
| Hawkesbury River | Water (M1 bridge only) | Separates Sydney from Central Coast |

## Congestion zones

Routes where travel time significantly exceeds what distance suggests.

| Zone | Pain point | Affects travel to/from |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| Military Road | Chronic congestion | Mosman, Cremorne, Neutral Bay |
| Spit Bridge | Opens for boats, queues badly | Northern Beaches |
| Victoria Road | Slow, no alternatives | Ryde, Drummoyne, Gladesville |
| Parramatta Road | Congested, poorly timed lights | Inner West to Parramatta |
| King Georges Road | North-south bottleneck | St George, Canterbury |
| Tom Ugly's/Captain Cook bridges | Peak hour queues | Sutherland Shire access |

---

## Corridors

Routes where travel is easier than distance suggests.

| Corridor | Connects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| M2 | Hills District ↔ North Shore / City | Tolled |
| M7 | Western Sydney north-south loop | Tolled, good for cross-west travel |
| M4 / WestConnex | Parramatta ↔ City ↔ Airport | Tolled |
| M5 | South-west ↔ Airport ↔ City | Tolled |
| NorthConnex | M1 ↔ M2 (bypasses Pennant Hills Rd) | Tolled |
| Pacific Highway | North Shore corridor | Free, parallels rail line |
| Hume Motorway | South-west to Campbelltown | Free |

## High-demand areas

Areas tradies commonly stretch their service area toward.

| Area | Why it pulls |
|------|--------------|
| Eastern Suburbs | High volume of renovation work |
| Lower North Shore | Established, high-value properties |
| Upper North Shore | Large homes, ongoing maintenance demand |
| Northern Beaches | Wealthy, isolated (local tradies have strong advantage) |
| Inner West | Dense renovation activity, heritage work |
| Hills District | Mix of established renos and new builds |
| South-West growth corridor | High volume new construction (Oran Park, Leppington, etc.) |
| North-West growth corridor | High volume new construction (Marsden Park, Box Hill, etc.) |

## Local terminology

Phrases tradies use that need clarification:

| Phrase | Could mean |
|--------|------------|
| "The bridge" | Harbour Bridge, Spit Bridge, or Georges River bridges — depends on context |
| "The Shire" | Sutherland Shire |
| "The Beaches" | Northern Beaches |
| "North Shore" | Could be Lower, Upper, or both |
| "The Hills" | Hills District (Castle Hill, Baulkham Hills, etc.) |
| "Out west" | Anywhere from Parramatta to Penrith — very broad |
| "The Gong" | Wollongong — outside Sydney metro |
| "The Coast" | Central Coast |
