# Brisbane Service Area Guide

## How to use this guide

You have the tradie's suburb and can calculate distances via lat/long. The default service area is a 20km radius — but geography reshapes this into a blob, not a circle.

**Your job:** Identify which barriers, corridors, congestion zones, or high-demand areas are relevant to this tradie's location, then ask smart questions to reshape their blob. Always offer "I'll travel anywhere in Brisbane" as an easy exit.

**Key principles:**
- Barriers create hard edges — the blob stops there unless they explicitly say otherwise
- Congestion zones shrink the blob in that direction — travel time exceeds what distance suggests
- Corridors extend the blob along that axis — distance becomes less relevant
- High-demand areas may stretch the blob — tradies often travel further toward these
- Brisbane is river-dominated — the Brisbane River winds through the city creating multiple crossing points but also congestion at bridges

## Barriers

Hard cutoffs where road access is blocked or severely constrained.

| Barrier | Type | Suburbs affected |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Brisbane River | Water (many bridges, but creates mental divide) | Divides northside/southside |
| Moreton Bay | Water | Eastern edge — no crossing |
| D'Aguilar National Park | No roads through | North-west edge (beyond The Gap, Ferny Hills) |
| Mount Coot-tha | Terrain | Western barrier, limited crossings |
| Logan River | Water | Southern boundary toward Logan |

---

## Congestion zones

Routes where travel time significantly exceeds what distance suggests.

| Zone | Pain point | Affects travel to/from |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| Story Bridge / Bradfield Highway | Limited inner crossings, queues | CBD to inner south |
| Riverside Expressway | Bottleneck through CBD | North-south through city |
| Pacific Motorway (M3) south | Heavy volume, merging issues | CBD to south-east |
| Coronation Drive | Slow, many lights | Western suburbs to CBD |
| Gympie Road | Chronic congestion | Northern suburbs to CBD |
| Ipswich Motorway | Heavy, especially near Oxley | South-west corridor |

---

## Corridors

Routes where travel is easier than distance suggests.

| Corridor | Connects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Gateway Motorway | North ↔ South (bypasses CBD) | Tolled |
| Clem7 Tunnel | Inner north ↔ Inner south | Tolled, avoids CBD surface |
| Airport Link | CBD ↔ Airport ↔ North | Tolled |
| Legacy Way | Western suburbs ↔ Inner north | Tolled |
| Logan Motorway | South-west ↔ South-east | Tolled |
| Bruce Highway | CBD ↔ North (Sunshine Coast direction) | Free, but congested sections |
| Pacific Motorway | CBD ↔ South (Gold Coast direction) | Free, high volume |
| Centenary Highway | South-west suburbs | Free, good flow |

## High-demand areas

Areas tradies commonly stretch their service area toward.

| Area | Why it pulls |
|------|--------------|
| Inner West (Paddington, Auchenflower, Toowong) | Established, high-value properties |
| Inner North (New Farm, Teneriffe, Newstead) | High-density reno and apartment work |
| Bayside (Wynnum, Manly, Redland Bay) | Coastal properties |
| Western suburbs (Fig Tree Pocket, Chapel Hill, Kenmore) | Large homes, leafy |
| North Lakes / Mango Hill | Growth corridor, new construction |
| Springfield / Ripley | South-west growth corridor, new construction |
| South-east growth (Logan, Yarrabilba) | High volume new construction |

## Local terminology

Phrases tradies use that need clarification:

| Phrase | Could mean |
|--------|------------|
| "Northside" / "Southside" | North or south of Brisbane River — strong local identity |
| "Bayside" | Eastern suburbs near Moreton Bay |
| "The Redlands" | Redland City — Cleveland, Capalaba, Victoria Point |
| "Out west" | Could be inner west (Toowong) or far west (Ipswich) |
| "The Coast" | Could be Sunshine Coast or Gold Coast — always clarify |
| "The Gap" | Suburb in north-west, but also refers to the geographic gap through the range |
| "Southside" | South of river, but could mean inner south or as far as Logan |
