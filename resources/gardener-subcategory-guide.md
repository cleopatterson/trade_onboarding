## Subcategory breakdown

| Subcategory | What it means in practice | Equipment/skill notes |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **General Gardening** | Catch-all for standard garden work — planting, tidying, light maintenance | Most gardeners offer this as their base service |
| **Garden Maintenance** | Ongoing regular care — weeding, pruning, tidying | Usually recurring work (weekly, fortnightly, monthly) |
| **Lawn Mowing** | Mowing lawns, edging, blowing | Very common, often standalone service |
| **Lawn Restoration and Repair** | Fixing damaged lawns — patching, reseeding, dethatching, aeration | More specialised than just mowing |

| **Fertilising** | Applying fertiliser to lawns and gardens | Knowledge of different fertiliser types and timing |
| **Garden Clean Ups** | One-off big cleanups — overgrown gardens, pre-sale tidy | Larger job than regular maintenance, often includes rubbish removal |
| **Garden and Green Rubbish Removal** | Removing garden waste, green bins, tip runs | Requires trailer or truck, tip fees may apply |

## Common patterns

**Lawn Mowing is often a standalone service.** Many "mow and go" operators just do lawns — they don't do garden beds, hedges, or planting. If someone's selected only Lawn Mowing, clarify if they do broader garden work.

**Garden Maintenance vs Garden Clean Ups** — maintenance is ongoing regular work; clean ups are one-off bigger jobs. Some gardeners prefer one or the other. Maintenance clients are recurring; clean ups are ad-hoc.

**Irrigation is a step up from basic gardening.** Installing sprinklers or drip systems requires knowledge of water pressure, pipe laying, timers, and controllers. Not all gardeners do this — some leave it to irrigation specialists.

**Rubbish Removal** requires a trailer or truck and involves tip fees. Some gardeners include removal in their service; others leave green waste for the customer to deal with. Worth clarifying.

**Artificial Turf** is a distinct skill. It's not just gardening — it involves removing existing lawn, ground prep, compacting, laying, joining, and infill. Many gardeners don't offer this.

**Grey Water Systems** cross over into plumbing and have regulatory requirements. This is specialist work — most gardeners don't touch it.
