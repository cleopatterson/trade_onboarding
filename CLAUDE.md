# Trade Onboarding Wizard

## Project Overview
Conversational AI wizard that guides Australian tradies through Service Seeking business onboarding in under 2 minutes. Replaces the static multi-step registration form with a chat interface.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Activate virtualenv (Python 3.9)
source venv/bin/activate

# Start server (port 8001)
python -m server.app

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8001
```

## Architecture
- **Server:** FastAPI (`server/app.py`) — endpoints, auto-chaining, session management
- **Agent:** LangGraph-inspired state machine (`agent/graph.py`) — 7 nodes, prompts inline, no-scripting principle
- **Tools:** ABR, NSW Fair Trading, Brave Search, geo helpers (`agent/tools.py`)
- **Frontend:** Single-file HTML/JS/CSS (`web/landing.html`) — landing page + wizard modal
- **Models:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (all nodes + classifiers) — Sonnet removed for speed

## Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server/app.py` | FastAPI server, auto-chaining, session state, button logic, logging |
| `agent/graph.py` | State machine nodes: welcome, business_verification, service_discovery, service_area, profile, pricing, complete (confirmation bypassed) |
| `agent/tools.py` | ABR lookup, NSW licence browse/details, Brave search, suburb grouping, website scraping, AI image filter |
| `agent/config.py` | Environment config, model IDs, API keys |
| `agent/state.py` | OnboardingState TypedDict |
| `web/landing.html` | Landing page + wizard modal (all-in-one) |
| `resources/suburbs.csv` | 15,761 AU suburbs (name, state, postcode, lat, lng, area, region) |
| `resources/subcategories.json` | SS category taxonomy |
| `resources/*-subcategory-guide.md` | Trade-specific gap question guides (plumber, electrician, cleaner, gardener) |
| `resources/*_subcategories.md` | Subcategory reference lists (plumbing, electrical, painter, carpentry) |
| `resources/*_regions.md` | Regional guides (sydney, melbourne, brisbane, perth) |

## Design Principles
1. **No scripting** — prompts provide context/goals/guides, LLM figures out the conversation
2. **Australian English** — "tradies", "ABN", "suburbs", mate-like tone
3. **Two turns max** per step — be decisive, don't over-ask
4. **Auto-chain** — steps flow seamlessly with parallel LLM calls where possible (service + area run simultaneously)
5. **Blue interactive, green success** — wizard uses blue (#0066cc) for actions, green (#1FC759) for progress/confirm only

## Conversation Flow
```
WELCOME → BUSINESS_VERIFICATION → SERVICE_DISCOVERY → SERVICE_AREA → PROFILE → PRICING → COMPLETE
```
- Confirmation step removed — services/areas editable directly on the profile preview
- Profile node generates LLM description + scrapes website images + AI filters photos
- Pricing node: data-driven (no LLM), recommends plan based on region count, 3-turn flow (plan → billing → done) or skip

## External APIs
ABR JSON API, NSW Fair Trading Trades API (OAuth2), Brave Search API. See `docs/PRD.md` Section 4 for details, `.env.example` for required keys.

## Development Notes
- Server runs on port **8001** (Concierge uses 8000)
- Python venv at `./venv/bin/python` — system Python won't have dependencies
- OAuth token pre-warmed on startup for NSW Trades API
- Per-session JSONL logging in `logs/` directory
- API call traces visible in browser dev tools console (color-coded)
- Prompt caching enabled for taxonomy + guides (large static context)
- LLM JSON fallback: if LLM returns plain text, wraps in default structure
- Suburbs CSV has some bad data: state filter + min 3 suburbs threshold filters junk regions
- Contact name extracted from NSW licence `associatedParties`, phone from Brave search descriptions
- Profile builder: card-based layout with SS blue hero, editable services/areas (pencil toggle → tap to remove)
- Profile description + intro generated by Haiku, website images filtered by Haiku vision (WORK/SKIP classification)
- Website discovery: infers business domain from name (tries .com.au/.au/.net.au), scrapes logo + photos
- Upload endpoint: `POST /api/upload` for logo + work photos (base64, max 5MB, photos capped at 6)
- Progressive loading with magic stars + API activity steps for key transitions
- Service discovery allows 2-3 gap questions with safety cap at 4 turns
- LLM JSON responses: strip markdown code fences before parsing (```json ... ```)
- Parallel auto-chain: service_discovery turn 2 + service_area turn 1 via asyncio.gather
- Deployed on Railway: https://trade-onboarding.up.railway.app
